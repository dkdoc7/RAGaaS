RAG Management System Test Document

This is a comprehensive test document for verifying the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system's functionality.

Section 1: Introduction
The RAG system combines vector search with large language models to provide accurate and contextual responses based on indexed documents.

Section 2: Key Features
- Multi-tenant knowledge base management
- Support for various document formats (TXT, PDF, Markdown)
- Multiple chunking strategies (Size-based, Parent-Child, Context-Aware)
- Advanced retrieval methods (Keyword, ANN, Two-Stage)

Section 3: Technical Architecture
The system uses Milvus as the vector database, FastAPI for the backend API, and React for the frontend interface. Documents are chunked, embedded using OpenAI's embedding models, and stored in Milvus for efficient similarity search.

Section 4: Use Cases
- Enterprise knowledge management
- Customer support documentation
- Research paper indexing
- Internal Wiki systems
- FAQ retrieval systems

Section 5: Performance Considerations
The two-stage retrieval approach improves precision by first using fast ANN search to retrieve candidates, then applying a cross-encoder for reranking to get the most relevant results.
